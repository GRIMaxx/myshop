# 🔍 Building a Search Engine from Scratch

**A complete open-source journey through search system architecture**

---

## 🎯 **Two Independent Systems, One Codebase**

### **1. ✅ Autocomplete System** ← **CURRENTLY BUILDING**
**Status:** Core synchronization complete • Frontend ready  
**What it does:** Real-time query suggestions as you type  
**Tech stack:** Laravel, Redis Streams, MeiliSearch, React

### **2. 🚧 Real Search Engine** ← **FUTURE PHASE**
**Status:** In planning • Code prototypes exist  
**What it will do:** Full-text search with ranking & facets  
**Tech stack:** [MeiliSearch], Advanced ranking algorithms

## 📚 **Current Focus: Building Autocomplete Step-by-Step**

### 🎯 **Learning Path (Active Development)**
1. **[01. Introduction & Big Picture](https://github.com/GRIMaxx/myshop/discussions/categories/introduction-big-picture)** - Core concepts & why it's hard
2. **[02. Data Storage & Architecture](https://github.com/GRIMaxx/myshop/discussions/categories/data-storage-architecture)** - Database design & system structure
3. **[03. Data Synchronization](https://github.com/GRIMaxx/myshop/discussions/categories/data-synchronization)** ← **BUILDING NOW**
4. **[04. Indexing & Search Logic](https://github.com/GRIMaxx/myshop/discussions/categories/indexing-search-logic)** - Coming soon
5. **[05. Frontend & UI](https://github.com/GRIMaxx/myshop/discussions/categories/frontend-ui)** - Coming soon
