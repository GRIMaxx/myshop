This is my personal marketplace project and a demonstration of my skills in working with Laravel 12, PHP, and other technologies.

I am planning a marketplace for 10,000,000+ products, and for such a large number of products, I need the most efficient and very fast product search in the search bar.
In this day and age, people have become very lazy, and the overload of advertising, outdated product lists, and so on have prompted me to create my own search engine.

I want customers to find what they are looking for 100% of the time from the first search, and most importantly, I want them to remain in a good mood while searching so that they will buy what they are looking for.
I took the best from my analysis of global websites...

And so, the main focus is on reactive search and optimization for maximum speed imaginable.

But there is a problem: since the code was copied more than 30 times in just one day, I will not be updating it publicly after October 4, 2025.

Guys, this is my experience and hard work, and it's very difficult, so I added a private repository where I will update my code and project every day as much as possible.  
Therefore, “employers” or people who are interested in the project and my ideas, I am happy to discuss joint work with you and welcome any help.

 I am currently looking for a job and am open to offers.

Thank you for your understanding!


## About the project
- Uses HTML/CSS3/SCSS/Bootstrap5/JS/React/Laravel 12, PHP 8, Redis, ...
- Responsive design
- CRUD operations
- 4 levels of data storage (for maximum optimization and super speed - 100+ tests were conducted)
- 3 levels of backend cache for super-fast data retrieval
- All core mechanisms run  on their own providers for scalability + flexibility, etc.
## Other

Guys, I am creating this project myself, and I am the only one adding dynamics to the template. 60% of the front end is taken from another author's HTML layout.
I may sometimes upload less code and sometimes more, as I said, only to the private repository. 
It all depends on my free time, but I try to work with the code for about 7+ hours during the day and 5+ hours at night.

Дорогие друзья я немного перенес в дискуссии свои тесты и планы на сборку поискового механизма в другую вкладку 

Если кому интересна "супер поисковая система" (Walmart,Aliexpress, Amazon и даже луче.. ) выше перейди на вкладку Discussions.
Или по ссылке там я буду добавлять что сделано и так далее…
